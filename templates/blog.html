        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>In today’s fast-paced world, people are often uncertain about their health and symptoms. It can be difficult to identify the root cause of illness without proper guidance. Our goal was to create a solution that helps users identify potential illnesses quickly based on the symptoms they experience.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Solution Section -->
      <section class="mb-5">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>We built a web app that takes user-inputted symptoms and uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the most likely disease. The app simplifies the process of identifying illnesses by combining AI with user-friendly design. Here’s how it works:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Symptom Input:</strong> Users enter their symptoms through a simple and intuitive interface.</li>
          <li><strong>Machine Learning Model:</strong> The app uses a Decision Tree Classifier model trained on a vast dataset of symptoms and diseases.</li>
          <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> The model predicts the most likely disease based on the symptoms entered.</li>
          <li><strong>Additional Information:</strong> The app provides useful information on the predicted disease, including descriptions, precautions, medications, and lifestyle recommendations.</li>
        </ol>
